# Technical Decisions Documentation

## Architecture Overview

### Core Technologies
- **Angular 19.2.0**: Latest version of the Angular framework for building robust web applications
- **Angular Material**: UI component library for consistent and modern design
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed programming language enhancing code maintainability
- **DummyJSON API**: External API service for backend simulation

### Development Tools
- **Cypress**: Modern end-to-end testing framework
- **Jasmine**: Unit testing framework for Angular applications
- **Angular CLI 19.2.0**: Command-line interface for Angular development

## Design Patterns and Principles

### SOLID Principles Implementation
- **Single Responsibility**: Each service and component has a single, well-defined purpose
- **Open/Closed**: Components are designed to be extended without modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Interfaces are designed for proper inheritance and polymorphism
- **Interface Segregation**: Small, specific interfaces for better modularity
- **Dependency Injection**: Angular's DI system for loose coupling

### Clean Code Practices
- **Descriptive Naming**: Clear and meaningful names for variables, functions, and components
- **Small Functions**: Functions are kept small and focused on single tasks
- **Self-Documenting Code**: Code written to be readable and self-explanatory
- **Consistent Formatting**: Adherence to Angular style guide

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Reusable components for common UI elements
- Shared services for common business logic
- Utility functions for repeated operations

## Component Architecture

### Modular Design
- Feature-based module organization
- Lazy loading implementation for optimized loading
- Shared module for common components

### Component Strategy
- Reusable components for delete and edit operations
- Unified product form component for create/edit operations
- Smart and presentational component pattern

## Accessibility Implementation

### ARIA Integration
- Proper ARIA attributes implementation
- Role="alert" for error messages
- Descriptive labels for form fields
- Keyboard navigation optimization

## Performance Optimization

### Lazy Loading Strategy
- Feature modules lazy loading
- Dynamic component imports
- Optimized bundle size management

### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
- Angular Universal implementation
- Prerendering disabled for dynamic content
- Performance optimization for low-end devices

## Testing Strategy

### End-to-End Testing (Cypress)
- Product form validation testing
- API error handling verification
- Complete product update flow testing
- User interaction simulation

### Unit Testing (Jasmine)
